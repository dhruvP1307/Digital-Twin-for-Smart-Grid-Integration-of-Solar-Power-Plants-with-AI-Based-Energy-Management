# Digital-Twin-for-Smart-Grid-Integration-of-Solar-Power-Plants-with-AI-Based-Energy-Management
**1. What the project does**
This project simulates a digital twin of a solar power plant integrated with a smart grid, using environmental and operational data to monitor, manage, and optimize energy generation, distribution, storage, and pricing. It incorporates AI-based energy demand prediction, efficient battery usage, and economic analytics, enabling smarter decisions in renewable energy operations.

**2. Why the project is useful**
Improves grid reliability by balancing variable solar output with real-time demand.
Optimizes energy storage and battery utilization, reducing energy wastage.
Enables predictive maintenance and proactive fault detection.
Supports sustainable energy adoption by making solar power more manageable and profitable.
Provides data-driven insights for energy pricing and economic returns.

**3. How users can get started with the project**
To get started:

Install MATLAB (with Simulink) or run the Python version using Jupyter Notebook.
